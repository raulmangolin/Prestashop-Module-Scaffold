### How to use

 1. Download or clone module into `modules` directory of your PrestaShop installation
 2. Rename the directory to make sure that module directory is named `mymodule`*
 3. Install module from Back Office

*Since the name of the directory and the name of the main module file must match.

### What it does

This module adds a CSS and a JavaScript in your store head.


### More Info 

I strongly recommend you choose another name to your module. And if you choose another name, remember to rename the `mymodule.php` and your contents.
